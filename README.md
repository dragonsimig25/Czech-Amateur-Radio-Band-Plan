# Czech Amateur Radio Band Plan

This project was created because I couldn't find any comprehensive Czech band plan for amateur radio in an accessible and open format.
It provides a detailed overview of all available frequency bands for amateur radio, CB communication, and other uses in the Czech Republic.

## Why This Project?

While searching for band plans, I found resources for various countries, but none covered the Czech Republic.
So, I decided to create my own open and easily accessible band plan.

## Contents

- A complete list of frequency bands for amateur and other uses.
- Structured JSON format for easy integration into applications.

## How to Contribute

If you have suggestions for improvements, feel free to create an issue or a pull request. Together, we can keep this project accurate and up-to-date.

## Usage

You can use this data in your own applications or as a reference for planning radio operations in the Czech Republic.
